## macOS

### Install
To install dependencies (Julia language and Pluto.jl) on macOS, double click `macos-install.command` in Finder. This only has to be done once. If you get a security error about the script being from an unidentified developer, you can bypass this by right clicking (control-clicking) the script and select `Open` then click the `Open` button on the security warning.

This process has three steps. The first two occur in the terminal, and the third will open a browser window. In between the first two steps there will be a pause with no output. In the browser stage, you can click the "status" button in the bottom right to see the progress. Depending on your internet speed and CPU this may take up to *10 minutes* to complete.

When you close the terminal window that the script opens, it will terminate the notebook process.

### Run
The install script described above only needs to be run once. To start the notebook in the future, all you need to do is double click `macos-run.command` in Finder which will run much faster than the first install (roughly 30 seconds to launch and load everything). If you get a security error about the script being from an unidentified developer, you can bypass this by right clicking (control-clicking) the script and select `Open` then click the `Open` button on the security warning.

When you close the terminal window that this script opens, it will terminate the notebook process.
